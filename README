A collection of tools for converting genome annotation between GTF (Gene Transfer Format), 
BED (Browser Extensible Data) and GFF (Generic Feature Format).

INTRODUCTION

Several genome annotation centers provide their data in GTF, BED, GFF3 etc. I have few programs 
they mainly deals with converting between GTF, BED and GFF3 formats. They are extensively tested 
with files from different centers like ENSEMBL, UCSC, JGI and NCBI AceView. Please follow the 
instructions below to clone these tools into your galaxy instance.

CONTENTS

Tool configuration files in *.xml format. 

    gtf_to_gff.xml
    gff_to_gtf.xml
    bed_to_gff.xml
    gff_to_bed.xml

Python based scripts. 

    gtf_to_gff_converter.py: converts data from GTF format to valid GFF3 format.
    gff_to_gtf_converter.py: converts data from GFF3 format to GTF format.
    bed_to_gff_converter.py: converts data from a 12 column UCSC wiggle BED format to GFF3 format.
    gff_to_bed_converter.py: converts gene transcript annotation from GFF3 format to UCSC wiggle 12 column BED format.

t: Test data set. (move to your galaxy_root_folder/test-data/)
    
    You may need to move the test files into your test-data directory so galaxy can find them. 
    If you want to run the functional tests eg as: 

    exmaple: 
    sh run_functional_tests.sh -id fml_gtf2gff3

REQUIREMENTS

    python
